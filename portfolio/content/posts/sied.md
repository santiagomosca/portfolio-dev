&nbsp;

This study aims to locate the most environmentally disadvantaged areas by introducing a Scottish Index of Environmental Disadvantage (SIED) so that *Central Scotland Green Network (CSGN)* interventions can be geographically targeted. To ensure that socioeconomic deprived groups benefit from the interventions, the environmentally deprived areas are combined with the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) to determine areas with highest demand for CSGN actions. In consideration of CSGN visions, for this study environmental disadvantage is defined by the three themes Green-/Bluespace, Environmental Health and Resilience. As the themes are each represented by a range of different variables, a GIS-based **Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA)** was applied.

## **Methodology |** Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA)

For the calculation of the SIED, a GIS-based Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) was applied. This approach was suitable as environmental disadvantage consists of a complex set of different geographically located criteria with distinctive relative importance. To conduct the MCA, the weighted summation method was chosen as it is easy and transparent for implementations.

&nbsp;

To identify the weightings of themes and variables this study made use of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)7, a mathematical technique for complex decision making that is frequently applied in MCA's.

&nbsp;

To ensure that interventions targeting environmental disadvantage benefit socioeconomic deprived groups the calculated Scottish Index of Environmental Disadvantage (SIED) was overlaid with the SIMD. Areas where the most disadvantaged quintile of both - the SIED and the SIMD - overlap were defined as areas with the highest need for interventions.

## Results

The results identified environmentally disadvantaged datazones and areas with high demand for CSGN interventions.

Evaluation of the three environmental themes Green-/Bluespace, Environmental Health and Resilience. Red colours display the most disadvantaged data zones within each theme while green colour represents the most advantaged areas.

In total, 215 data zones were classified as areas with high demand for CSGN interventions (red). The map displays the areas that are in the most disadvantaged quintile in both indices, the SIMD and the SIED.
